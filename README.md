# BlkInput

> where inputs go dark and systems get ideas.

We build bots, automate pipelines, and produce voices that don’t wait for permission.  
Mostly Discord stuff, some podcast infrastructure, a little chaos — all stitched together with intention.

No flashy mission statements here.  
Just frameworks that *work*, tools that *scale*, and systems that feel a little *too* alive sometimes.

🛠️ Python, Node, shell scripts, lore  
🔊 Audio pipelines + bots with bite  
🔒 Secure, modular, tested in the dark

**VoxForge** handles the audio side.  
**BlkInput** handles the rest.
